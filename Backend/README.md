# Backend Overview

This backend is built using Node.js and Express. It manages user, captain, ride, and mapping functionalities.

## Setup and Connection Guide

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the backend directory: cd `RideSimple/Backend`
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Configure environment variables: create/edit .env as needed.
5. Start the server: npx nodemon
6. Test endpoints using tools like Postman.

## Socket.io Integration

This backend uses Socket.io for real-time communication. When users or captains connect, their socket ids are stored, enabling:
- User connection and notifications.
- Real-time ride updates for captains.
- Location updates from captains during rides.
